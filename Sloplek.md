## Abilities

### Rogue
- **Sneak Attack.** Once per turn, you can deal an extra *3d6* damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can spend a die for a special effect:
  - **Poison** (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

  - **Trip** (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.

  - **Withdraw** (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- **Uncanny Dodge** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you (round down).
- **Cunning Action.** On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.
- **Skirmisher.** You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Survivalist** You gain proficiency in the *Nature* and *Survival* skills if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.
- **Steady Aim** As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Weapons
 - **Junky +1 Dagger.** You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this dagger, which looks like junk. When it is used, its grip frays, its blade chips, and it flakes rust. If you get a natural 1 on an attack roll while wielding this weapon, it breaks and becomes nonmagical.
 - **Dagger** 1d4 damage. light, finesse

### Plasmoid
- **Amorphous.** You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide, provided you are wearing and carrying nothing. You have advantage on ability checks you make to initiate or escape a grapple.
- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
- **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for 1 hour.
- **Natural Resilience.**
You have resistance to acid and poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
- **Shape Self.** As an action, you can reshape your body to give yourself a head, one or two arms, one or two legs, and makeshift hands and feet, or you can revert to a limbless blob. While you have a humanlike shape, you can wear clothing and armor made for a Humanoid of your size.
- **Pseudopod.** As a bonus action, you can extrude a pseudopod that is up to 6 inches wide and 10 feet long or reabsorb it into your body. As part of the same bonus action, you can use this pseudopod to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object. The pseudopod contains no sensory organs and can't attack, activate magic items, or lift more than 10 pounds.

### Background (Smuggler)
 - **Down Low** While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM's discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a safe house, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a secret.

### Feats
- **Speedy** 
  - *Dash over Difficult Terrain.* When you take the Dash action on your turn, Difficult Terrain doesn't cost you extra movement for the rest of that turn.
  - *Agile Movement.* Opportunity Attacks have Disadvantage against you.
